# HackSC 2017 project Trojan-Day

#### This is a project for Trojan Hacks 2.0 in March 2017. I met my teammates Young Jin Kim and Daniyal Javed. We three were all first time hackers in a hackthon. We spent 24 hours to build this small app based on R, Shiny. You can visit the demo at [my shinyapps.io site](https://rongpenl.shinyapps.io/usc_today/). Note that it may be slow to load for the first time.
